## Functional analysis
* When you first see the site, all of the shows are displayed
* The filters are displayed at the top as a list of keywords
* clicking a filter once selects it, clicking a filter again deselects the filter
* there is also a link that clears the filters
* you have two kinds of filters: genre and audience
* The genre filters have the amount of results between brackets next to them
* selecting only an audience filter only changes the numbers between the brackets of the genre filters, not the actual results
* selecting only a genre filter shows you all the results for that genre
* selecting both an audience and a genre filter shows you all the results of that genre and for that audience
* you can select more than 1 filter and it will show all of the results for those filters
